# Data Visualisation with Tableau
Hey there! This repository is where I share my adventure of diving into Tableau as a beginner🤓. I'm thrilled to embark on this journey 🏞 and discover this new tool🔧 for the very first time. 

I spruced up the `ds_salary.twb` file by adding a bunch of delightful images🖼️ from my dashboard and storyboards 📖. 

Also, I whipped up three charming reports 🧾 that captured the evolution of my ideas💡 as I ventured through exploration and experiments🧪.

I hope my work catches your eye and leaves a sweet impression! 🍎
