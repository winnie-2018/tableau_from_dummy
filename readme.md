# Data Visualisation with Tableau
Hey there! This repository is where I share my adventure of diving into Tableau as a beginner. I'm thrilled to embark on this journey and discover this new tool for the very first time. 

I spruced up the `ds_salary.twb` file by adding a bunch of delightful images from my dashboard and storyboards. Also, I whipped up three charming reports that captured the evolution of my ideas as I ventured through exploration and experiments.

I hope my work catches your eye and leaves a sweet impression!
